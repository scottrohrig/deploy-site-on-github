    GithHub has a great feature that allows us to host a static website for free. This can be very useful as a way to show off your application, profile or individual projects. 


Using gh-pages:
    step 1. Navigate to the repository you would like to make a page for.
    step 2. Click on the 'âš™ Settings' button.
    step 3. Click the 'Pages' option  
    step 4. Under 'Source' select 'main' from the dropdown menu, then 'Save'.
    
    You may now view your live site published at "your-username".github.io/"your-repository-name"/. Just make sure to substitute your username and your repository name.

Common issues:
    - choosing a branch that is not 'main'
    - Why does my live site get a 404 error?

        - this occurs when the repository does not contain the appropriate files.
            - To fix this, the main branch must have either an index.html or index.md file in the root directory of the repository.
            
        - this occurs when the current branch does not contain the same files as the Source branch.
